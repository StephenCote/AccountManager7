olio (hodgepodge) contains a variety of data randomization and evolution models and utilities.

Evolution
The original evolution rules were pretty rudimentary - Run through a set of hard-coded random rules across locations twelve times a year (once a month) to simulate birth, death, marriage, divorce, immigration.  Also, there was no real way to interrupt the process in the middle of an evolution so it was in no way interactive.

The following is the current thinking on the context and evolution cycle, and related data structures:

Data:
	- Data is split between the 'universe' and the 'world'.  Static and template data is loaded into the universe, which is technically in an adjacent set of groups
	- Evolution data (or that data intended to change or track state) is copied as needed into the 'world', or generated directly in the world
	- For example: World location data is loaded in the 'universe'.  Evolution specific location data is copied into the 'world'.  Or, when using generated maps, the initial map generation is placed in the 'universe' and the evolution data and cell level data in the 'world'

Context
	- The Olio Context primarily relates events and locations.
		- At the moment, there are no specific 'community', 'civilization', 'country' associations at the context level - it's up to the locations and rules to stipulate
		- A realm model exists to represent these, and includes a pointer to the origin location given that temporal event context originates from those points
		
	- Events are organized in the following hierarchy:
		- Construction - the root event for the world contains construct and incept events for introduced locations
		
Time (Machine)
	- When the olio models are journaled (by inheriting data.journalExt), they allow a sort of 'time machine' effect to take place on event sequences
	- A simulation may run over a period of time, and then, at any point in the sequence, it could be forked at a particular place and time into a separate 'world', which could then proceed with it's own variation and history from the point of divergence
	- For example, journaling state, statistics, personality, and instinct would allow the unique qualities of a character to be retrieved from a point in time
	- Note: participations are not yet covered by journaling, so inventories and relationships are not yet covered  

Context Rules (IOlioContextRule):
	- Rules evaluated during context initialization and setup.  This allows for creating custom locations or picking locations from any loaded world data.
Evolution Rules (IOlioEvolutionRule):
	- Rules evaluated during evolution cycles. This will allow for tailoring the progression over a particular event.
	- There currently isn't the concept of civilizations or countries
	- Rather, there are populations of people in locations, associated with an initial location. 

Rule Evaluation:
Where the original data generator created generic life events on a monthly basis, the new version is meant to configurable, allowing to use whichever rules are desired.
   
	
Locations and Mapping
Locations can use global geolocation data with correct latitudes, longitudes, and names,
or generated locations to use the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS)

Terrain blasting and walking is used to create the semblance of a landscape, though the results won't be very realistic since there's zero attention paid to elevation, weather, etc.

Openness + Imaginative, curious, creative, open-minded, adaptable - Unfocused, impractical, prone to overthinking, unpredictable

+ Creativity (std attribute)
+ Spirituality (std attribute)
+ Magic ~ Fae = avg(creativity, spirituality, willpower, wisdom) (Reclassify magic/fae potential from its own discrete value to an average of other values)
+ Science = avg(intelligence, creativity, wisdom)

ORIGINAL RAW NOTES
The following raw notes were taken from a thirty-year-old table-top gaming system I developed and played out.  The logic will be used as an example set of population rules. 


Attributes are measured in points, and cap at 20 (initial allotment 100).  Fae caps at 200.
Skills are measured in percentages, and initially cannot be allocated above 50%.  Fae skills cost 4x. Skills decay from disuse over time (100 - skill%) = days before 1% decay.  Skills don't decay belowe 60%.

Attributes: 
Physical strength
Physical endurance
Agility
Speed
Mental strength
Intelligence
Wisdom
Fae (Magic)
Manual dexterity
Charisma: Not personality - prejudicial attitudes towards character's relative looks, relative interaction with people



Reaction = (Agility + Speed + Wisdom) / 3
Fight:
   - roll to hit (fight/weapon skill).
   - roll to dodge (agility + speed) or parry (fight/weapon skill against equal or lesser class)
   - if hit and not dodged or parried, go to ADS

Parry:
   - (skill % - attack) = ParryModifier (PM)
   - (ParrySkill - PM) = Minimum percent to parry
Armor Damaging System (ADS)
   - (a) total armor hit points: total amount of armor protection
   - (b) armor stress point: number needed to pierce/puncture/break through armor
   - (c) armor absorption percentage: armor protection percentage
   
   - (d) effective attack skill (calculated): (fight/weapon skill - absorption(c))
   - (e) damage calculation: 5% - (c) = target and armor damaged; (c) to (fight/weapon skill) = armor damaged; above (skill) miss
   - Eg: Weapon skill 75%.  Absorbtion 35%.  Target and armor take damage below 40%, while only armor between 40 and 75, and above 75 is a miss

Area Fubar Chart:
1) Minor shockwave or small effect
2) Stronger, noticeable effect. Low damage to those in short radius (10m)
3) Definate effect noticed, all present aware the person did something, damage to 15m
4) Strong effect noticed, all present in 20m take damage
5) Concussion level shock wave, all in 40m take damage
6) Dangerous level of activity, anyone in 60m take damage
7) Anyone in 80m take damage
8) Anyone in 120m take damage

Magic/Skill types:
1) innate capacity - everyday person, essentially doesn't really stand out
2) some capacity - must train to low/mid level effect
3) high capacity - high affinity and may be trained to maximum degree and effect

Critical determination
For critical states, an additional percent is rolled:
0 - 50%: Regular outcome
51 - 85%: Double outcome
86 - 95%: Triple/messed-up outcome
96 - 00%: Deadly/total outcome 

Saving throws:
Death, Sickness/Poison, Magic: ((strength, health, willpower)/3) x 5 = Save death Percent
