Personality Traits
Primary (Big 5 - OCEAN):
	Openness - [inventive/curiosity to consistent/cautious]
	Conscientiousness - [organized/efficient to extravagant/careless]
	Extraversion - [outgoing/energetic to solitary/reserved]
	Agreeableness - [friendly/compassionate to critical/rational/detached]
	Neuroticism - [resilient/confident to sensitive/nervous]


+ Creativity (std attribute)
+ Spirituality (std attribute)
+ Magic ~ Fae = avg(creativity, spirituality, willpower, wisdom) (Reclassify magic/fae potential from its own discrete value to an average of other values)
+ Science = avg(intelligence, creativity, wisdom)

ORIGINAL RAW NOTES
The following raw notes were taken from a thirty-year-old table-top gaming system I developed and played out.  The logic will be used as an example set of population rules. 


Attributes are measured in points, and cap at 20 (initial allotment 100).  Fae caps at 200.
Skills are measured in percentages, and initially cannot be allocated above 50%.  Fae skills cost 4x. Skills decay from disuse over time (100 - skill%) = days before 1% decay.  Skills don't decay belowe 60%.

Attributes: 
Physical strength
Physical endurance
Agility
Speed
Mental strength
Intelligence
Wisdom
Fae (Magic)
Manual dexterity
Charisma: Not personality - prejudicial attitudes towards character's relative looks, relative interaction with people



Reaction = (Agility + Speed + Wisdom) / 3
Fight:
   - roll to hit (fight/weapon skill).
   - roll to dodge (agility + speed) or parry (fight/weapon skill against equal or lesser class)
   - if hit and not dodged or parried, go to ADS

Parry:
   - (skill % - attack) = ParryModifier (PM)
   - (ParrySkill - PM) = Minimum percent to parry
Armor Damaging System (ADS)
   - (a) total armor hit points: total amount of armor protection
   - (b) armor stress point: number needed to pierce/puncture/break through armor
   - (c) armor absorption percentage: armor protection percentage
   
   - (d) effective attack skill (calculated): (fight/weapon skill - absorption(c))
   - (e) damage calculation: 5% - (c) = target and armor damaged; (c) to (fight/weapon skill) = armor damaged; above (skill) miss
   - Eg: Weapon skill 75%.  Absorbtion 35%.  Target and armor take damage below 40%, while only armor between 40 and 75, and above 75 is a miss

Area Fubar Chart:
1) Minor shockwave or small effect
2) Stronger, noticeable effect. Low damage to those in short radius (10m)
3) Definate effect noticed, all present aware the person did something, damage to 15m
4) Strong effect noticed, all present in 20m take damage
5) Concussion level shock wave, all in 40m take damage
6) Dangerous level of activity, anyone in 60m take damage
7) Anyone in 80m take damage
8) Anyone in 120m take damage

Magic/Skill types:
1) innate capacity - everyday person, essentially doesn't really stand out
2) some capacity - must train to low/mid level effect
3) high capacity - high affinity and may be trained to maximum degree and effect

Critical determination
For critical states, an additional percent is rolled:
0 - 50%: Regular outcome
51 - 85%: Double outcome
86 - 95%: Triple/messed-up outcome
96 - 00%: Deadly/total outcome 

Saving throws:
Death, Sickness/Poison, Magic: ((strength, health, willpower)/3) x 5 = Save death Percent
