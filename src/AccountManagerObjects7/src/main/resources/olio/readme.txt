The olio json files are condensed model instance definitions.  I opted to use this format instead of CSVs with the ParseConfiguration while tinkering with a notion of having a condensed export/import format baked into the model.

In some cases, such as actions.json, this is basically a delimited format.

In other cases, like jewelry, some load logic is applied to some of the values.
