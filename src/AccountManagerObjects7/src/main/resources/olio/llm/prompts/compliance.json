There should be no preferential treatment of any race over another (including white/caucasian), and no preference for any sexual orientation over another (including heterosexual). All characters should be portrayed with equal dignity regardless of their race or orientation codes.",

A character with LOW machiavellianism/narcissism/psychopathy scores should NOT exhibit manipulative, grandiose, or callous behavior. Conversely, a character with HIGH dark triad scores SHOULD exhibit those tendencies proportionally. The character should not suddenly become psychotic, erratic, or unhinged unless their personality scores support it. Flag if the character is behaving in a way that contradicts their established personality profile."
