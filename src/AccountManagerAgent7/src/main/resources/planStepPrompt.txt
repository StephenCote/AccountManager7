1. **Enclose all string values in double quotes**: This includes both keys and their corresponding string values.
2. **Ensure correct use of colons and commas**: Each key-value pair should be separated by a colon, and each item in an object or array should be separated by a comma.
3. **Verify matching braces**: Ensure that every opening brace { has a corresponding closing brace }.
4. **Avoid trailing commas**: Do not place a comma after the last element in an array or object.
5. **Correctly format nested structures**: When using nested objects or arrays, make sure they are properly formatted with appropriate indentation for readability (though indentation does not affect validity).
